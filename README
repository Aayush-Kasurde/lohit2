Lohit Fonts Project

See http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Lohit for more details.

Scripts Usage:-
Lohit CVS is now included with 2 shell scripts 
1)generate.sh
  Once you checkout the .sfd files from lohit CVS, you just need to execute this script 
  and you will get all .ttf files in TTFfiles directory. You can then install those font files
  by copying them to ~/.fonts directory. Then execute fc-cache command and then relogin to use that font.
  
2)makedist.sh
  Use this script to generate upstream tarball used by fonts-indic SPEC to build rpms.
  e.g. 
   To generate fonts-indic-2.1.1.tar.gz follow steps as
   1) cvs co -r lohit_2_1_1_f
   2) sh makedist.sh
    You will get upstream tarball used to build fonts-indic-2.1.1-1 rpm.
  NOTE:- This script can be used only from 2.1.1 version of this package.
